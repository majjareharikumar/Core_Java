Title:-Data Exporter Tool for Domain-Specific S3 Data Transfer

I am working on a Data Exporter tool that moves data from producer Mercury S3 to consumer Mercury S3 based on domain and sub-domain classification.
The service reads metadata to identify the domain and sub-domain of each dataset and applies validation rules before initiating the transfer.
We use secure IAM roles and bucket policies to ensure only authorized S3 locations can access the data.
The transfer process is implemented as a fault-tolerant workflow with retry mechanisms and failure handling to avoid partial or corrupted exports.
To handle large volumes of data efficiently, the system supports parallel file transfers and streaming.
Logging and monitoring are implemented to track export status and failures.
This design ensures scalable, secure, and controlled data movement across domains.
