//What is a Leap Year?
//-->A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of 365. It happens every 4 years to help synchronize the calendar with the Earth's orbit around the sun.
//âœ… Leap Year Rules:
//A year is a leap year if:It is divisible by 4 AND Not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400
//y%4==0 || y%400==0 & y%100!=0
