🌟 Main Features Introduced in Java 17 (LTS Version)
1️⃣ Sealed Classes
Sealed classes restrict which other classes can extend or implement them.
This helps maintain better control and design of inheritance hierarchies.
It improves code readability and security by preventing unwanted subclassing.

Example:
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}
final class Circle extends Shape {}
final class Rectangle extends Shape {}

✅ Real-World Example: Payment System
🎯 Business scenario
In a banking or e-commerce system, payment can be only a few known types:
Credit Card
Debit Card
UPI
No other payment type should be allowed.

2️⃣ Pattern Matching for instanceof
Pattern matching for instanceof allows you to check the type and cast the object in one step.
It removes the need for explicit casting and makes code cleaner and safer.

Example:
Object obj = "Hello";

Old Way (Before Java 16)
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String s = (String) obj;
    System.out.println(s.length());
}

New Way
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()); // No need for manual cast
}

3️⃣ Switch Expressions (Standard Feature)
Switch expressions, previewed in Java 12–13, became standard in Java 17.
They allow returning values directly from switch and support arrow (->) syntax.

Example:
String day = "MON";
int result = switch (day) {
    case "MON", "TUE" -> 1;
    case "WED" -> 2;
    default -> 0;
};

4️⃣ Text Blocks (Standard Feature)
Text Blocks are a Java feature that allows you to write multi-line strings easily using """.
They remove the need for \n, \t, and string concatenation.
This makes large text content more readable and maintainable.

Before Text Blocks (Old Way)
String json = "{\n" +
              "  \"id\": 1,\n" +
              "  \"name\": \"Hari\"\n" +
              "}";

With Text Blocks (Java 17)
String json = """
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Hari"
        }
        """;

5️⃣ Records (Standard Feature)
Records are a new way to create immutable data classes with less boilerplate code.
They automatically generate constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString().

Example:
public record Employee(String name, int age) {}
Employee emp = new Employee("Hari", 28);
System.out.println(emp.name()); // Accessor method

Java 17, an LTS release (after Java 11), introduced Sealed Classes, Records, Pattern Matching, Switch Expressions, Text Blocks, and new Random Generators.
It focused on simplifying code, strong encapsulation, and modernizing JVM performance with ZGC, and improved security.

Difference
--------------
Java 8 introduced functional programming features like Lambdas, Streams, and the Date-Time API.
Java 11 focused on modern APIs like the new HTTP Client, String/File enhancements, and ZGC.
Java 17, the latest LTS, brought Sealed Classes, Records, Pattern Matching, Text Blocks, and improved GC.
Each version improved readability, performance, and modularity, making Java 17 the most powerful and developer-friendly LTS so far.
