🌟 Main Features Introduced in Java 17 (LTS Version)
1️⃣ Sealed Classes
Sealed classes restrict which other classes can extend or implement them.
This helps maintain better control and design of inheritance hierarchies.
It improves code readability and security by preventing unwanted subclassing.

Example:
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}
final class Circle extends Shape {}
final class Rectangle extends Shape {}

2️⃣ Pattern Matching for instanceof
Java 17 simplified type casting after using instanceof.
You can directly declare a variable in the condition instead of using explicit casting.

Example:
Object obj = "Hello";
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()); // No need for manual cast
}

3️⃣ Switch Expressions (Standard Feature)
Switch expressions, previewed in Java 12–13, became standard in Java 17.
They allow returning values directly from switch and support arrow (->) syntax.

Example:
String day = "MON";
int result = switch (day) {
    case "MON", "TUE" -> 1;
    case "WED" -> 2;
    default -> 0;
};

4️⃣ Text Blocks (Standard Feature)
Text blocks (introduced in Java 15) became stable in Java 17.
They make writing multi-line strings easier and cleaner, especially for JSON or SQL.

Example:
String json = """
    {
        "name": "Hari",
        "age": 25
    }
    """;
System.out.println(json);

5️⃣ Records (Standard Feature)
Records are a new way to create immutable data classes with less boilerplate code.
They automatically generate constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString().

Example:
public record Employee(String name, int age) {}
Employee emp = new Employee("Hari", 28);
System.out.println(emp.name()); // Accessor method

Java 17, an LTS release (after Java 11), introduced Sealed Classes, Records, Pattern Matching, Switch Expressions, Text Blocks, and new Random Generators.
It focused on simplifying code, strong encapsulation, and modernizing JVM performance with ZGC, and improved security.

Difference
--------------
Java 8 introduced functional programming features like Lambdas, Streams, and the Date-Time API.
Java 11 focused on modern APIs like the new HTTP Client, String/File enhancements, and ZGC.
Java 17, the latest LTS, brought Sealed Classes, Records, Pattern Matching, Text Blocks, and improved GC.
Each version improved readability, performance, and modularity, making Java 17 the most powerful and developer-friendly LTS so far.
