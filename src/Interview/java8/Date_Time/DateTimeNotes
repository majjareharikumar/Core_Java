->The Java 8 Date and Time API (in java.time package) provides an immutable, thread-safe, and more readable way to handle dates and times.
->It introduces main classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and ZonedDateTime to represent date, time, and time zones.
->LocalDate handles only the date (year, month, day) without time.
->LocalTime handles only the time (hour, minute, second).
->LocalDateTime combines both date and time without timezone information.
->ZonedDateTime is used when you need date and time with a specific timezone.
->Period and Duration are used to measure time differences (in days or seconds).
->The DateTimeFormatter class formats and parses date-time objects in custom patterns.

Example:
import java.time.*;
public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();

        System.out.println("Date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Time: " + time);
        System.out.println("DateTime: " + dateTime);
    }
}

🕒 Difference between Old and New Date-Time API (Java 8)

Package:
  Old API classes are in java.util and java.text.
  New API is in java.time package (JSR-310).
Mutability:
  Old classes like Date and Calendar are mutable (values can be changed).
  New API classes are immutable and thread-safe, making them suitable for multithreaded environments.
Design:
  Old API design is poor and confusing (e.g., months start from 0, year offset from 1900).
  New API is well-designed and more readable, using clear class names and methods.
Time Zone Handling:
  Old API requires separate TimeZone class handling.
  New API includes classes like ZonedDateTime and ZoneId for easy timezone support.
Date/Time Representation:
  Old API mixes both date and time in a single Date object.
  New API separates concerns using LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime.
Formatting and Parsing:
  Old API uses SimpleDateFormat, which is not thread-safe.
  New API uses DateTimeFormatter, which is immutable and thread-safe.
Ease of Use:
  Old API needs many adjustments for calculations and comparisons.
  New API provides easy methods like plusDays(), minusWeeks(), isBefore(), and isAfter().
