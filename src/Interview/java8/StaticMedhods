A static method in an interface is defined using the static keyword and contains a method body.
It belongs to the interface, not to the class that implements it.
Hence, it can be called only using the interface name, not through the implementing class or its object.
It helps in placing common reusable code (like validation or calculations) inside interfaces.
Static methods cannot be overridden by implementing classes.
They are mainly used for utility, factory, or helper methods inside interfaces.

üí° Example:
interface Vehicle {
    static void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    // Cannot override startEngine()
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle.startEngine(); // ‚úÖ called using interface name
        // new Car().startEngine(); ‚ùå Not allowed
    }
}
