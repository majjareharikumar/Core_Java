✅ What is Circuit Breaker?
A Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used in microservices to prevent repeated calls to a failing service.
When a dependent service is slow or down, the circuit breaker opens and stops further calls temporarily.
Instead of waiting and failing repeatedly, it returns a fallback response.
This protects the system from cascading failures.
Once the service recovers, the circuit breaker closes and traffic resumes normally.

✅ Circuit Breaker States
Closed – Normal state, requests go through
Open – Service is failing, requests are blocked
Half-Open – Few test requests are allowed to check recovery
