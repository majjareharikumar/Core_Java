1)In microservice, If one service is having some failures and causing other service failures. How we can resolve this?
In microservices architectures, when one service fails and causes failures in other services, this is known as "cascading failure." To address this and improve system resilience, you should implement several key strategies:

1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Explanation: A circuit breaker protects services from repeatedly trying to perform an operation that's likely to fail. When failures reach a threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and further calls are automatically rejected for a set period.
Real-Time Example: In Netflix's microservice architecture, if the Recommendation service is down, the API Gateway's circuit breaker prevents further calls to it for a while, instead serving default recommendations or a fallback message to users.

2. Timeout and Retry Policies
Explanation: Set reasonable timeouts for service calls so a failing service does not tie up resources in other services. Pair this with retry policies, ensuring retries are limited and use exponential backoff.
Real-Time Example: In a payment system, the Order service sets a timeout for payment confirmation. If the Payment service takes too long, the Order service cancels the transaction and notifies the user, rather than hanging indefinitely.

3. Bulkhead Pattern
Explanation: Bulkheads isolate critical resources so that a failure in one part of the system doesn't bring down the entire application.
Real-Time Example: In a travel booking platform, if the car rental service becomes overloaded, a bulkhead ensures that flight and hotel services continue functioning, only isolating the car rental component.

4. Graceful Degradation & Fallbacks
Explanation: Services should offer degraded functionality when dependencies fail.
Real-Time Example: If a news website's "Like" service is down, the site continues serving news stories but hides or disables the "Like" button, rather than failing the entire page.

5. Proper Monitoring and Alerting
Explanation: Real-time monitoring helps detect failures immediately, reducing mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR).
Real-Time Example: E-commerce companies like Amazon utilize distributed tracing and monitoring (such as AWS X-Ray) to identify and isolate microservice failures quickly.

2)We have one scenario, our microservice is get huge traffic and due to this our app become slow and performance also low. how we can solve this?
When your microservice experiences huge traffic, causing your app to become slow and impacting performance, you can apply several proven strategies to resolve these issues.
-->Auto-Scaling (Horizontal Scaling)
What it means: Automatically add more instances (containers, pods, or VMs) of your service when traffic increases, and scale them down when demand drops.
How it works in real life: Companies like Uber and Netflix use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically spin up more microservice instances when CPU or memory usage spikes, efficiently handling traffic surges and maintaining performance.

-->Load Balancing
What it means: Distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of your microservice so no single instance becomes a bottleneck.
Tools used: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer, or a cloud-native API Gateway.
Real example: E-commerce sites distribute millions of requests per minute across many app server instances using advanced load balancing, ensuring smooth user experiences during peak sales events.

-->Caching
What it means: Store frequently accessed data temporarily using cache (Redis, Memcached), reducing repeated expensive computations or database hits.
Real example: News sites cache trending articles and recommendations, providing instant responses to usersâ€”even during peak hours when the back-end database could slow down from query overload.

-->Rate Limiting and Throttling
What it means: Control how many requests clients can make in a certain time period, protecting your services from being overwhelmed by traffic spikes or abusive users.
Real example: APIs apply rate limiting to enforce quotas, ensuring no single user or client can degrade service for others.

-->Asynchronous Processing/Queueing
What it means: Long-running tasks or heavy computations are queued and processed in the background. This frees up the main service so it handles requests faster.
Real example: Order processing systems put payment and order fulfillment tasks on queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka), letting the API respond instantly to users and process the order asynchronously.
