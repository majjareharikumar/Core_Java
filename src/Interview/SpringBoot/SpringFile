ðŸ”¹ What is @SpringBootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a core annotation in Spring Boot used on the main class of the application.
It is a combination of @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
This means it allows us to define beans, enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration based on dependencies,
and scans the package for components like services, controllers, and repositories.
By using this single annotation, we can quickly bootstrap and run a Spring Boot application with minimal configuration.
ðŸ”¹ How it works
When you run the Spring Boot application (using SpringApplication.run()), the @SpringBootApplication annotation triggers:
Auto-configuration â†’ sets up beans automatically.
Component scanning â†’ detects your beans in the specified package.
Configuration â†’ allows you to define custom beans if needed.

ðŸ”¹ Important Spring Boot Annotations
@SpringBootApplication â†’ Main annotation to bootstrap a Spring Boot app. Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
@RestController â†’ A combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody. Used to create REST APIs where methods directly return JSON/XML instead of views.
@RequestMapping / @GetMapping / @PostMapping â†’ Used to map HTTP requests to controller methods (GET, POST, etc.).
@Autowired â†’ Enables dependency injection by letting Spring automatically inject beans into a class.
@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller â†’ Stereotype annotations used to define Spring-managed beans.
They help organize code by layer (generic, service, DAO, and controller layers).
@Entity â†’ Marks a class as a JPA entity (table in the database).
@Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column â†’ JPA annotations used for database mapping of entities.
@EnableAutoConfiguration â†’ Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.
@Configuration â†’ Indicates a class defines beans using @Bean methods.
@Value â†’ Injects values from application.properties or environment variables into fields.
@Profile â†’ Allows beans or configurations to load only for specific environments (like dev, test, prod).
@SpringBootTest â†’ Used for writing integration tests in Spring Boot.

ðŸ‘‰ Interview Short Answer (6â€“7 lines):
"Spring Boot provides many annotations to simplify development.
The main one is @SpringBootApplication to start the app.
 For REST APIs we use @RestController with request mapping annotations like @GetMapping.
 Dependency injection is done using @Autowired. Stereotypes like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller define beans for different layers.
 JPA annotations like @Entity, @Id, and @Column handle database mapping.
 We also use @Value for property injection, @Profile for environment-specific beans, and @SpringBootTest for testing."

ðŸ”¹ What is the  of @component and @service and difference
In Spring, @Component is a generic stereotype annotation used to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean.
When we annotate a class with @Component, Spring automatically detects it during component scanning and registers it in the application context.
It is the most general-purpose annotation and can be applied to any class that should be managed by Spring, such as utility or helper classes.
Since it is not tied to a specific layer, it serves as the base annotation for other specializations like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
In short, @Component makes a class eligible for Springâ€™s dependency injection and lifecycle management.

In Spring, @Service is a specialized form of @Component that is specifically used to mark classes belonging to the Service layer.
It indicates that the class holds business logic and should be managed as a Spring bean.
Functionally, it behaves the same as @Component since it is also detected during component scanning and registered in the application context.
However, using @Service improves readability and clarity, as it clearly communicates the role of the class within the layered architecture.
In addition, Spring or third-party frameworks may apply extra processing to beans annotated with @Service in future enhancements.
In short, @Service is used when defining business logic classes, while still acting as a Spring-managed component.

In Spring, both @Component and @Service are stereotype annotations used to mark classes as Spring-managed beans,
 and functionally they behave the same because @Service is internally meta-annotated with @Component.
 The difference lies in their intended usage and readability.
 @Component is a generic annotation that can be applied to any class, such as utility or helper classes,
 while @Service is a specialized annotation meant for the Service layer, where business logic is implemented.
 Using @Service makes the code more meaningful and clear within a layered architecture,
 even though Spring loads both in the same way during component scanning.

 Which annotation will load first component or service
 In Spring, there is no load order difference between @Component and @Service.
 Both are discovered during component scanning and registered as beans in the Spring ApplicationContext.

 The key point is:

 @Service is just a specialized form of @Component (internally, it is meta-annotated with @Component).
 Since both are processed by the same component-scanning mechanism, Spring does not prioritize one over the other.
 The loading order is determined by component scanning rules and not by whether the class is annotated with @Component or @Service.



ðŸ”¹ Spring Profiles

Spring Profiles in Spring Framework are used to manage environment-specific configurations.
They allow defining different beans/settings for dev, test, and prod environments.
We can activate profiles using properties, command-line, or programmatically.
Beans can be annotated with @Profile, and only beans of the active profile are loaded.
This ensures clean separation of configurations across environments.
You can activate a profile using:
application.properties â†’ spring.profiles.active=dev
Command line â†’ --spring.profiles.active=prod
Programmatically using SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles().

How it Works
You can annotate beans with @Profile("dev") or @Profile("prod").
Spring will only create/load beans for the active profile.

Example:
@Configuration
@Profile("dev")
class DevConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return new HikariDataSource(); // Dev DB
    }
}
