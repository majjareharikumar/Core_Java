ðŸ”¹What is a ClassLoader in Java?
A ClassLoader is a part of JVM that dynamically loads Java classes into memory at runtime.
It reads .class files and converts them into Class objects. Without it, JVM wouldnâ€™t know how to load external classes.
It follows the parent delegation model for security and consistency.

ðŸ”¹What are the different types of ClassLoaders?
->Bootstrap ClassLoader â†’ loads core Java classes (java.lang.*).
->Extension/Platform ClassLoader â†’ loads classes from extension directories (jre/lib/ext).
->System/Application ClassLoader â†’ loads classes from the classpath (user classes, jars).
->Custom ClassLoader â†’ created by developers for special loading (e.g., from network).
