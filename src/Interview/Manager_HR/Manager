1️)Tell Me About Yourself (Manager Version)
I have around 4 years of experience working as a Java Developer at JP Morgan Chase.
I work mainly on Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Microservices.
I have strong experience in production support, handling incidents and performing root cause analysis.
I’ve worked with Kafka for asynchronous communication and DB2 for database operations.
I regularly use Splunk, Grafana, and Dynatrace for monitoring.
I also write JUnit tests and participate in code reviews and Agile ceremonies.
Currently, I’m looking for a role with more ownership and development exposure.

2)What are your roles and responsibilities?” – Sample Answer
In my current role, I work as a Java Developer and handle both development and production support activities.
I am responsible for designing and developing REST APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA.
I work on microservices, integrate with Kafka for event-based communication, and ensure proper data handling with DB2.
I handle production issues, perform root cause analysis, and fix bugs with minimal impact.
I also monitor applications using Splunk, Grafana, and Dynatrace to ensure system stability.
Additionally, I write unit tests using JUnit, manage code through Git, and actively participate in code reviews and Agile ceremonies.

3)Tell Me About a Production Issue You Handled
  In one incident, an API was slow during peak hours.
  My responsibility was to identify the root cause quickly.
  I analyzed logs in Splunk and traced the issue using Dynatrace.
  I found an inefficient database query causing the delay.
  I optimized the query and tested the fix thoroughly.
  After deployment, performance improved significantly.
  The issue was resolved within SLA with no business impact.

4)How Do You Handle Pressure or Tight Deadlines?
  I stay calm and first understand the priority and impact.
  I break tasks into smaller pieces and focus on critical items first.
  I communicate clearly with stakeholders about timelines.

  If needed, I ask for help early instead of delaying.
  I regularly update progress to the team.
  This approach helps me deliver on time with quality.

5)What Do You Do If You Don’t Know Something?
  If I don’t know something, I first analyze the problem.
  I refer to documentation and existing code.
  I try small experiments in lower environments.
  If needed, I discuss with seniors or teammates.
  I make sure to understand the solution clearly.
  I document the learning for future reference.

6)How Do You Handle Production & Development Together?
  I clearly understand priorities and SLAs.
  Production issues always take higher priority.
  I manage time by planning development tasks properly.
  I communicate status clearly with the team.
  Once production is stable, I continue development work.
  This balance ensures stability and delivery.
  It has helped me handle both responsibilities effectively.

7)Describe a Challenge You Faced and How You Solved It
We faced a production issue where the Kafka consumer lag was increasing and messages were processing slowly.
On analysis, we noticed frequent consumer rebalancing during peak traffic.
The root cause was a large batch size and low poll interval, causing processing to exceed the poll timeout.
Kafka assumed the consumer was unhealthy and kept rebalancing.
To fix this, we reduced the batch size using max.poll.records from 500 to 100.
We also increased max.poll.interval.ms from 60000(1 min) to 300000(5 min)to match the actual processing time.
Additionally, we disabled auto-commit to commit offsets only after successful processing.
We tested the changes in lower environments and monitored lag metrics.
After deployment, consumer lag reduced and message processing became stable.

8)Why Are You Looking for a Change?
I have gained strong experience in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices while working at JP Morgan Chase.
I’ve also handled production support, which helped me build strong problem-solving skills.
Now, I’m looking to move into a role with more development ownership and design exposure.
I want to work on challenging features end-to-end, not just support activities.
I’m interested in learning more about scalable systems and architecture.
Your organization offers opportunities that align well with my technical background.
