Function in SQL
-----------------------
A Function is a reusable SQL object that always returns a value (scalar or table).
It is mainly used for calculations or transformations inside queries.
Functions cannot perform INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (read-only).
They must return exactly one result.
Often used in SELECT, WHERE, or JOIN clauses.
Example: calculating age from date of birth.
