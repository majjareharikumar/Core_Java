Stored Procedure in SQL
-------------------------
A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements stored in the database.
It can perform multiple tasks like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Procedures may return data or nothing (flexible).
They support loops, conditions, and transactions.
Often used for business logic, reporting, or bulk operations.
Example: processing payroll or fetching employee details.

âš¡ Easy memory trick:
Stored Procedures are used for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
