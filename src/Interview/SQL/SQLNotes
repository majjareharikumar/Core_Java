Stored Procedure in SQL
-------------------------
A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements stored in the database.
It can perform multiple tasks like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Procedures may return data or nothing (flexible).
They support loops, conditions, and transactions.
Often used for business logic, reporting, or bulk operations.
Example: processing payroll or fetching employee details.

⚡ Easy memory trick:
Stored Procedures are used for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

DQL(Data Query language)
-----------------------------
1) Select queries
syntax:-
 select * from tableName;
 select columnName1, columnName2... from tableName;
 select * from tableName where <condition>;

DML(Data Manipulation language)
-------------------------------
1)Insert
Syntax:-
Insert into tableName values();
Insert into tableName(ename,sal,empno) values('Hari',700000,101);

2)Update
syntax:-
update tableName
set columnName=value
where <condition>;

3)Delete
syntax:-
delete from tableName
where <condition>

DDL(Data Definition language)
-------------------------------
1)create
syntax:-
create tableName(
columnName1 datatype(size) constraint,
columnName2 datatype(size) constraint,
columnName3 datatype(size) constraint,
.
.
.
);

2)Alter
->Add new column
 Alter tableName
 add columnName datatype(size) constraint;

->Modify column
 Alter tableName
 modify columnName new datatype(size) new constraint;

->Rename columnName
  alter tableName
  rename column oldColumnName to newColumnName;

3)Drop
syntax:-
drop table tableName;

4)Truncate
syntax:-
truncate table tableName;

5)Rename
syntax:-
rename oldTableName to newTableName

TCL(Transaction control language)
-----------------------------------
1)commit

2)rollback

3)savePoint


✅ Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR
CHAR is a fixed-length data type that always stores data in the full defined size (pads with spaces).
VARCHAR is a variable-length data type that stores only the actual characters entered.
CHAR is faster for fixed-size fields because its size never changes.
VARCHAR is more flexible and memory-efficient for variable-length text.
Use CHAR for items like codes/IDs, and VARCHAR for names, addresses, and descriptions.

✅ difference b/w delete, drop, truncate
->DELETE
It is a DML command.
Removes specific rows from a table using a WHERE clause.
Rollback possible (can undo).
Table structure remains.

->TRUNCATE
It is a DDL command.
Removes all rows from a table (no WHERE).
Cannot rollback in most DBs.
Table structure remains.

->DROP
It is a DDL command.
Completely deletes the table from the database.
Fast and removes data + structure.
Can rollback from recycle bin
Table becomes unavailable permanently.

✅ Primary Key and Foreign Key
A Primary Key uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot be NULL or duplicate.
Each table can have only one Primary Key, and it ensures row-level uniqueness.
A Foreign Key is a column that links one table to another table's Primary Key.
It can have duplicate or NULL values (unless restricted by rules).
Foreign Keys ensure referential integrity between tables.
Together, they maintain proper relationships and prevent invalid data.
