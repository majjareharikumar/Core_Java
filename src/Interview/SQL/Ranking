🔹 What is Ranking in SQL?
-----------------------------
Ranking in SQL means assigning a position (rank/number) to each row based on some ordering criteria (like salary, marks, sales).
It is done using window functions such as RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER().
Ranking is helpful when we want to find top performers, highest salaries, best sellers, leaderboards, etc.
For example, if we rank employees by salary, the one with the highest salary gets rank 1, the next gets rank 2, and so on.
If two rows have the same value (tie), the way ranks are assigned depends on which ranking function is used.

Employee Table (sample data)
emp_id	name	dept	salary
1	    Hari	IT	    70000
2	    John	HR	    60000
3	    Ravi	IT	    60000
4	    Meena	Finance	 50000
5	    Sita	IT	    40000

🔹 What is ROW_NUMBER() in SQL?
ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique sequential number to each row, based on ordering.
Unlike RANK() and DENSE_RANK(), it doesn’t care about duplicates every row gets a different number.
For example, when ranking employees by salary, even if two employees have the same salary, they get different row numbers.
It is widely used in pagination, finding duplicate rows, and selecting the top N records.

Query: Assign row numbers based on salary (highest to lowest)
SELECT name, dept, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;

Result:
name	dept	salary	row_num
Hari	IT	    70000	1
John	HR	    60000	2
Ravi	IT	    60000	3
Meena	Finance	50000	4
Sita	IT	    40000	5

👉 Notice: Even though John & Ravi have the same salary, they still got different row numbers (2 and 3).

🔹 What is RANK() in SQL?
RANK():- in SQL is a window function that assigns a rank to each row based on an ORDER BY clause.
If two or more rows have the same value, they get the same rank, but the next rank is skipped (creating gaps).
The syntax is:

RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY colX ORDER BY colY DESC)

It is commonly used in ranking scenarios like top salaries, student marks, or sales reports.
For example, if two employees share 2nd place in salary ranking, the next employee will be ranked 4th.

sample query:-
--------------
Rank employees by salary (highest to lowest)
SELECT name, dept, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;

Result:
name	dept	salary	salary_rank
Hari	IT	     70000	1
John	HR	    60000	2
Ravi	IT	     60000	2
Meena	Finance	50000	4
Sita	IT	    40000	5

👉 Notice: John & Ravi have the same salary → both get rank 2, and the next rank becomes 4 (gap created).

🔹 What is DENSE_RANK() in SQL?
DENSE_RANK() assigns ranks to rows based on ordering but does not skip ranks when there are ties.
If two employees have the same salary, they both get the same rank, and the next rank continues normally.
For example, if two employees share 2nd place, the next one gets rank 3 (not 4).
It is commonly used in salary analysis, student marks, or leaderboard rankings where continuous ranks are preferred.

Query: Rank employees by salary (highest to lowest)
SELECT name, dept, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;

Result:
name	dept	salary	salary_rank
Hari	IT	    70000	1
John	HR	    60000	2
Ravi	IT	    60000	2
Meena	Finance	50000	3
Sita	IT	    40000	4
