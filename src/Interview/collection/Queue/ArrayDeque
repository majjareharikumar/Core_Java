Definition
----------------
ArrayDeque is a class in Java that implements the Deque interface and represents a resizable array-based double-ended queue.
It allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends efficiently and can be used as a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO).

Key Features
--------------
Allows null elements? → No, null elements are not allowed.
Supports insertion and removal from both ends (addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast).
Resizable array grows automatically as needed.
Faster than LinkedList in most cases due to better locality of reference.
Not thread-safe (can use Collections.synchronizedDeque() for concurrency).

Internal Implementation (6–7 lines)
-----------------------------------------
ArrayDeque is implemented using a resizable circular array.
When an element is added at the front or rear, the array is adjusted using head and tail pointers, wrapping around the array if necessary.
If the array becomes full, it is dynamically resized (usually doubled in size).
Methods like addFirst() and addLast() adjust the pointers and insert the element.
Removal operations (removeFirst(), removeLast()) simply update the pointers, giving O(1) amortized time.
Unlike PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque does not maintain sorting, but provides fast stack or queue operations.
