Definition
----------------
LinkedList is a class in Java that implements the List and Deque interfaces.
It stores elements as a doubly-linked list, allowing insertion and deletion of elements from any position efficiently.
It can also be used as a queue or stack.

Key Features
---------------
Maintains insertion order.
Allows duplicate and null elements.
Efficient insertion and deletion (O(1) if position is known).
Slower random access (O(n)) because it requires traversal from the head or tail.
Implements List, Deque, and Queue interfaces, so can function as list, stack, or queue.

Internal Implementation
----------------------------------
LinkedList is internally implemented as a doubly-linked list, where each node contains a data element, a reference to the previous node, and a reference to the next node.
When an element is added, a new node is created and linked appropriately.
Removal updates the previous and next references to unlink the node.
Methods like get(index) traverse the list from the head or tail to locate the element.
It allows null values and duplicates, and because there is no contiguous array, resizing is not needed.
Using it as a queue or stack leverages the head and tail pointers for O(1) insertion and removal at ends.
