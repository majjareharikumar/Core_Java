Definition:
Vector is a legacy class in Java that implements the List interface.
It is similar to ArrayList but synchronized, making it thread-safe for multi-threaded environments.

Key Features:
---------------
Maintains insertion order.
Allows duplicate and null elements.
Synchronized, so safe for concurrent access, but slower than ArrayList.
Resizable array; grows automatically when capacity is exceeded.

Internal Implementation (6â€“7 lines):
Vector internally uses a dynamic array to store elements.
When an element is added using add(), it is placed at the next available index.
If the array is full, it doubles in size by default (can be customized).
Elements are accessed via index, giving O(1) time for get() and set().
Insertion/deletion in the middle requires shifting elements.
Synchronization ensures thread safety, but adds overhead compared to ArrayList.
