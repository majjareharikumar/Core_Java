Definition:
Stack is a legacy class in Java that extends Vector and implements a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
It is used to push, pop, and peek elements in stack order.

Key Features:
---------------------
LIFO structure: last inserted element is removed first.
Thread-safe (because it extends Vector).
Allows duplicate and null elements.
Provides methods like push(), pop(), peek(), empty(), and search().

Internal Implementation (6â€“7 lines):
Stack is internally implemented as a Vector, so elements are stored in a resizable array.
push() adds an element at the end of the array, pop() removes and returns the last element, and peek() returns the last element without removing it.
Thread-safety is ensured via synchronized methods inherited from Vector.
Because it uses a dynamic array, resizing occurs when the capacity is exceeded.
Iteration over Stack can be done like any other Vector, but typical usage is LIFO access.
