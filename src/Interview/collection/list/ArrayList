Definition
-----------------
ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface in Java.
It allows duplicate elements, maintains insertion order, and provides indexed access to elements, making it ideal when you need fast random access.

Key Features
-----------------
Maintains insertion order.
Allows duplicate and null elements.
Provides fast random access (O(1)) via index.
Insertion/deletion in the middle is slower (O(n)) because elements may need to be shifted.
Not synchronized (use Collections.synchronizedList() for thread safety).

Internal Implementation
--------------------------------------
Internally, ArrayList uses a resizable array to store elements.
When you add an element using add(), it is placed at the next available index.
If the internal array is full, it is automatically resized (usually 50% larger than current size).
Elements are accessed directly using the index, giving O(1) time for get and set operations.
Insertion or deletion in the middle requires shifting elements to maintain order.
ArrayList allows null values and can store duplicates, unlike Set implementations.
