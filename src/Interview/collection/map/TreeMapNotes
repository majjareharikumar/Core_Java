Definition
------------
TreeMap is a Java class that implements the NavigableMap and SortedMap interfaces.
It stores key–value pairs in a Red–Black Tree (a self-balancing binary search tree).
Keys are always kept in sorted order, either by their natural ordering or by a custom Comparator provided at map creation.
It does not allow null keys but allows multiple null values.

Internal Working
-----------------------
Internally, TreeMap uses a Red–Black Tree, which ensures the tree remains balanced after every insertion or deletion.
In the put(key, value) operation, TreeMap traverses the tree using key comparison to find the correct position, inserts the node, and rebalances the tree to maintain red-black properties.
The get(key) operation searches through the tree by comparing the key with nodes until it is found.
The remove(key) operation deletes the node and again rebalances the tree to keep performance consistent.
Since it uses a balanced tree, all operations like put, get, and remove work in O(log n) time.
TreeMap is best when you need sorted data, range queries, or ordered traversal of keys.
