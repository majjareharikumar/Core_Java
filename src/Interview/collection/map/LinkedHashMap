---------------
LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap that maintains a doubly-linked list across all entries to preserve the insertion order (or access order if enabled).
It allows one null key and multiple null values, just like HashMap.
Since it extends HashMap, it provides the same average O(1) performance for put, get, and remove, but with predictable iteration order.

Internal Working (7â€“8 lines)

Internally, LinkedHashMap works the same as HashMap with an array of buckets and collision handling using linked lists or red-black trees (Java 8+).
The difference is that each entry is also part of a doubly-linked list that maintains order.
When we call put(key, value), it calculates the hash, finds the bucket, and inserts the node;
additionally, it links the node at the end of the order-maintaining list.
The get(key) operation works like HashMap but if access-order mode is enabled, the accessed entry is moved to the end of the list.
The remove(key) operation removes the entry both from the bucket and the linked list.
This ensures predictable iteration order while still providing fast lookups and updates.
