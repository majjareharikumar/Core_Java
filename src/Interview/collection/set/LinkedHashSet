Definition
----------------
LinkedHashSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface and extends HashSet.
It stores unique elements and maintains a doubly-linked list across all entries to preserve insertion order (or access order if enabled).

Key Features
------------
Stores unique elements only (no duplicates).
Maintains insertion order (or access order if access-order mode is enabled).
Allows one null element.
Provides O(1) average-time complexity for add, remove, and contains operations.
Not synchronized (use Collections.synchronizedSet() for thread safety).

Internal Implementation (6–7 lines)
--------------------------------------
LinkedHashSet is internally implemented using a LinkedHashMap.
When you add an element, it is stored as a key in the LinkedHashMap with a dummy constant object as the value.
Each entry is also part of a doubly-linked list to preserve the insertion order.
Collisions are handled by the underlying hash table (linked list → red-black tree conversion for large buckets in Java 8+).
Methods like contains() and remove() operate on the underlying map, ensuring O(1) average-time complexity.
Iteration over the set follows the insertion order.
