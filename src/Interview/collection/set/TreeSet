Definition
-----------------
TreeSet is a class in Java that implements the Set interface and is backed by a Red-Black Tree via TreeMap.
It stores unique elements in sorted order (natural order or via a custom Comparator) and does not allow duplicate entries.

Key Features
--------------
Stores unique elements only (no duplicates).
Maintains sorted order of elements.
Allows null only once (and only if set is empty; otherwise throws NullPointerException).
Provides O(log n) time complexity for add, remove, and contains operations.
Implements NavigableSet and SortedSet, offering methods like ceiling(), floor(), higher(), and lower().

Internal Implementation
----------------------------------------
TreeSet is internally implemented using a TreeMap.
When you add an element, it is stored as a key in the TreeMap with a dummy value.
The TreeMap is a Red-Black Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring that all operations remain O(log n).
The tree automatically keeps elements sorted during insertion.
Lookup, addition, and removal traverse the tree to maintain order and balance.
Iteration over a TreeSet returns elements in ascending order by default.
