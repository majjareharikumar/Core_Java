-----------------
The Set interface in Java is part of the Collections Framework and represents a collection of unique elements — it does not allow duplicate values.
It extends the Collection interface and provides the base for implementations like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
Unlike lists, sets do not maintain elements by index, and ordering depends on the implementation.

Extending Interfaces of Set
-----------------------------
SortedSet → Provides a set with elements sorted in natural order or by a custom comparator.
NavigableSet → Extends SortedSet and provides navigation methods like higher(), lower(), ceiling(), and floor().

Main Implementation Classes of Set
-----------------------------------
HashSet → Backed by HashMap, does not maintain order, allows one null element, and ensures unique elements.
LinkedHashSet → Extends HashSet, maintains insertion order using a doubly-linked list, allows one null.
TreeSet → Implements NavigableSet, stores elements in a red-black tree, keeps them sorted, does not allow null.
EnumSet → Special high-performance set for enum types only.
CopyOnWriteArraySet → Thread-safe variant using CopyOnWriteArrayList, good for concurrent access.
