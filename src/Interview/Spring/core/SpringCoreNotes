Before the Spring Framework, Java developers mainly relied on Java EE (J2EE) and Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) to build enterprise applications.
J2EE provided APIs like Servlets, JSP, JDBC, JMS, and JNDI, but working directly with them required writing a lot of boilerplate code.
EJB was introduced to handle complex needs such as transactions, security, and distributed systems, but it was heavyweight and complicated.
Developers had to write multiple files like Home Interface, Remote Interface, and Deployment Descriptors just for a single bean, which slowed development.
On top of that, EJBs could only run on heavy application servers like JBoss, WebLogic, or WebSphere, making testing and debugging difficult.
Some developers also used frameworks like Struts for MVC and Hibernate for ORM, but integrating them manually was not easy.
Overall, enterprise development before Spring was complex, tightly coupled, and time-consuming, which created the need for a lightweight, flexible, and testable framework.
Spring solved this by using simple POJOs, Dependency Injection, and modular design, making development faster and easier.


definition:-
-----------
Spring Framework is an open-source, lightweight, and modular Java framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for building enterprise applications.
It simplifies application development by promoting Dependency Injection (DI), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and using Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) instead of complex enterprise components like EJB.
Spring helps developers create applications that are loosely coupled, testable, and easily maintainable, while also integrating smoothly with other technologies like Hibernate, JPA, JDBC, Kafka, and JMS.

Its architecture is designed around two core principles: Dependency Injection (DI) and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
