@ConditionalOnMissingClass in a spring boot is used to load bean or configuration when the class or dependencies
are not present in the classpath. It is opposite to ConditionalOnClass.
When ever the mentions driver is not present in classpath, spring boot will load the default beans.
We could create a default bean directly, But it will load even the real dependency exists.It will cause the conflict or duplicate beans.

@ConditionalOnMissingClass will use the reflection to check whether class is present or not at runtime.If present it will skip.
OR if not, it will load the bean or configuration.
