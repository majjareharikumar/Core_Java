@ConditionalOnProperty in spring boot is used to load bean or configurations conditionally based on the property
set in the application.properties or yml file. It will help us to load the bean which is required based on the
values we set in the configuration class. If a method is annotated with @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "sqlconnection.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = false)
and in app.property file we set sqlconnection.enabled=true, Then spring will load this bean.

It will ensure unnecessary beans to load.

There is one scenario , In our application we are using mysql connect and nosql connection .
Some time we need nosql to test our changes and we need mysql to store that changed values.Here if we are not using
ConditionalOnProperty , Spring will load 2 beans at a time. We don't required 2 beans here. In this case
If we want to load mysql , then in app.property file we can set mysqlconnection.enabled=true and
configuration method with @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "sqlconnection.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = false).
Now spring will load the bean of mysql only. If we set nosql is tru then nosql will load.

✅ Advantages:
Feature control at runtime – You can enable or disable beans/configurations without changing code.
Environment flexibility – Works well for different environments (dev, test, prod) by changing property values.
Lightweight and modular – Beans are only loaded if needed, saving resources.
Avoids manual checks – Spring handles the conditional loading automatically based on properties.
Supports optional modules – Useful for feature toggles/flags, making applications flexible and configurable.

❌ Disadvantages:
Property misconfiguration risk – Wrong property name or value can prevent bean loading, leading to runtime issues.
Harder to debug – Conditional beans may be missing silently if properties are not set correctly.
Limited to property-based conditions – Cannot handle complex logic beyond simple property checks.
Overuse can clutter configs – Using it excessively can make configuration hard to follow.
