@PreDestroy is a lifecycle annotation in Spring that is used to execute a method just before a bean is destroyed by the Spring container.
It is commonly used for cleanup tasks, such as closing resources, releasing connections, or stopping background threads.
The annotated method is called only once per bean and is typically used in classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Configuration.

@Component
class EmployeeService {

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("EmployeeService bean is being destroyed. Cleaning up resources.");
    }

    public String getEmployee() {
        return "John Doe";
    }
