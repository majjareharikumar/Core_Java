@PostConstruct is a lifecycle annotation in Spring that is used to execute a method immediately after a bean is initialized by the Spring container.
It is typically used for initialization tasks, like setting up resources or performing validation after dependency injection.
The annotated method is called only once per bean.
It is commonly used in classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Configuration.

@Component
class EmployeeService {

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("EmployeeService bean has been initialized.");
    }

    public String getEmployee() {
        return "John Doe";
    }
