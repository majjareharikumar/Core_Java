⚙️ What is DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)?
->DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms — it’s the foundation of writing efficient and optimized code.
->A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
    Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps.
->Data Structures help manage data efficiently, while Algorithms help process that data effectively.
->For example, choosing between a HashMap (O(1)) and a List (O(n)) for searching can make a huge difference in speed.

🧩 Types of Data Structures
Data Structures are mainly divided into two types — Linear and Non-Linear.
=>Linear Data Structures:
Data elements are arranged sequentially (one after another).
Traversal happens in a single level (one direction).
Examples:
 Array – fixed-size structure storing elements in contiguous memory.
 Linked List – nodes connected using pointers.
 Stack – follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
 Queue – follows FIFO (First In, First Out).

=>Non-Linear Data Structures:
Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or connected way.
Traversal can happen in multiple directions.
Examples:
 Tree – hierarchical structure (used in databases, XML parsing).
 Graph – set of nodes and edges (used in networks, shortest path).
Linear = one-to-one relationship; Non-linear = one-to-many or many-to-many.

⚙️ When to Use Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures
->Linear Data Structures are used when data needs to be processed sequentially, one element after
->Non-Linear Data Structures are used when data has hierarchical or network-like relationships.

🌍 Real-Time Scenarios of Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures
=>Linear Data Structures – Real-Time Example:
Imagine a food delivery app (like Swiggy or Zomato) showing your order history — the orders are listed one after another in order (latest to oldest).
This uses a List or Queue, where data is processed sequentially — first order, second order, and so on.
Another example: Undo/Redo feature in editors uses a Stack (LIFO) structure.

==>Non-Linear Data Structures – Real-Time Example:
A file system on your computer (folders inside folders) is a perfect example of a Tree structure — root → subfolders → files.
A social network (like LinkedIn or Facebook) uses a Graph to show connections — each user is a node, and relationships are edges.

⏱ What is Time Complexity?
Time Complexity is the measure of how much time an algorithm takes to run as the size of input increases.
It helps us analyze the performance of an algorithm without actually running it.
It is usually expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²)).
It doesn’t measure real “clock time” — it measures the number of basic operations the algorithm performs.
Example:
A for loop running n times → O(n).
A nested loop → O(n²).
A binary search → O(log n).

💾 What is Space Complexity?
Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses while executing.
It includes memory for variables, data structures, input values, recursion stack, and temporary storage.
It helps analyze how efficiently an algorithm uses memory as input size (n) increases.
Example:
int sum = 0;      // uses constant space → O(1)
int[] arr = new int[n]; // uses extra memory for n elements → O(n)

The space complexity of this code is O(n) because the array grows with input size, while variables use constant memory.
