1. What is multithreading in Java?
Answer:
Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
Each thread is a lightweight sub-process that shares the same memory space.
It helps to perform tasks in parallel, improving CPU utilization and performance.
For example, you can download a file while typing in a text editor.
Java provides multithreading support via the Thread class and Runnable interface.
It’s commonly used in gaming, servers, and real-time applications.

2. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
Answer:
A process is an independent unit of execution with its own memory space.

A thread is a smaller unit of execution inside a process and shares memory with other threads.
Processes are heavy and take more time to switch, while threads are lightweight and switch faster.
In Java, multiple threads can run inside a single Java program (process).

3. How do you create a thread in Java?
Answer:
There are two main ways to create a thread in Java:
Extending the Thread class and overriding the run() method.
Implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread object.
Using Runnable is preferred when you want to extend another class, as Java doesn't support multiple inheritance.

4. What is the lifecycle of a thread?
Answer:
A Java thread goes through these states:
New → Thread is created but not started.
Runnable → Thread is ready to run.
Running → Thread is executing.
Blocked/Waiting → Thread is paused for a condition.
Terminated (Dead) → Thread has finished or stopped.

5. What is the difference between start() and run()?
Answer:
Calling start() creates a new thread and calls the run() method in a separate thread.
Calling run() directly just runs the method like a normal function in the main thread.
So, always use start() to actually create a new thread.

6. What is synchronization in Java? Why is it needed?
Answer:
Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads.
It prevents race conditions where two or more threads try to change shared data at the same time.
You can use the synchronized keyword in methods or blocks.
It ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the critical section.
15. What is a race condition?
Answer:
A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time.
Because the thread execution order is unpredictable, it can lead to inconsistent results.
It’s typically fixed using synchronization or atomic variables.

7. What is a deadlock in multithreading?
Answer:
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting forever for each other to release locks.
For example, Thread A holds Lock1 and waits for Lock2, while Thread B holds Lock2 and waits for Lock1.
This situation causes the threads to be stuck forever.
To avoid deadlock, always acquire locks in a fixed order.

How to Avoid Deadlocks in Java?
✅ 1. Always Acquire Locks in a Fixed Order
Make sure all threads acquire locks in the same order.
If Thread A locks Resource 1 then Resource 2, all other threads should follow the same order.

🔸 Example:
synchronized(lock1) {
    synchronized(lock2) {
        // do something
    }
}

 2. Use Try-Lock with Timeout (from ReentrantLock)
Instead of waiting forever, try to acquire the lock with a timeout using tryLock().
This way, thread can back off if lock is not available.

🔸 Example:

if (lock1.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    try {
        if (lock2.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            try {
                // do work
            } finally {
                lock2.unlock();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        lock1.unlock();
    }
}


8. What is a thread pool?
Answer:
A thread pool is a collection of pre-created threads that can be reused to execute tasks.
It improves performance by avoiding the cost of creating a new thread for every task.
Java provides ExecutorService and Executors to manage thread pools.
Example: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5) creates a pool of 5 threads.

9. What is the difference between wait() and sleep()?
Answer:
wait() is used for inter-thread communication and releases the object lock.
sleep() is used to pause a thread for some time and doesn't release the lock.
Also, wait() must be called inside a synchronized block, while sleep() doesn’t need it.
Both throw InterruptedException.

10. What is the difference between Runnable and Callable in Java?
Answer:
Runnable has a run() method and doesn’t return a result or throw checked exceptions.
Callable has a call() method, returns a result, and can throw checked exceptions.
Callable is used with ExecutorService and returns a Future object.

11. What is the volatile keyword in Java?
Answer:
The volatile keyword tells the JVM that a variable’s value may change unexpectedly, so threads should always read it from main memory, not from their local cache.
It ensures visibility, not atomicity.
It’s useful when multiple threads read/write a shared variable.
Example: private volatile boolean flag = false;

12. What is the difference between synchronized and volatile?
Answer:
synchronized is used for mutual exclusion (only one thread can access a block at a time) and visibility.
volatile only provides visibility, not mutual exclusion.
Use synchronized when you need atomicity, and use volatile for simple flags or status sharing.

13. What is inter-thread communication in Java?
Answer:
Inter-thread communication allows threads to communicate and cooperate using methods like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().
One thread can pause itself using wait(), and another can wake it up using notify().
These must be used inside a synchronized block.
Example: Producer-Consumer problem.

14. What are daemon threads?
Answer:
Daemon threads are background service threads that run in the background and do not prevent the JVM from exiting.
Examples include Garbage Collector and monitoring threads.
Set a thread as daemon using thread.setDaemon(true) before calling start().
JVM exits when only daemon threads are left.



16. How does join() work in threads?
Answer:
The join() method makes the current thread wait until the target thread finishes execution.
Example: thread.join();
It’s useful when one thread depends on another thread’s result before continuing.
It throws InterruptedException.

17. What is ThreadLocal in Java?
Answer:
ThreadLocal provides thread-specific variables. Each thread accessing it gets its own independent copy.
It’s useful when you don’t want threads to share variables.
Example: database connection per thread.
Syntax:
ThreadLocal<Integer> local = new ThreadLocal<>();

18. What are Atomic classes in Java?
Answer:
Atomic classes (like AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean) are part of the java.util.concurrent.atomic package.
They provide lock-free, thread-safe operations on single variables.
Useful alternative to synchronized for counters or flags.

19. What are the benefits of multithreading?
Answer:
Better CPU utilization by running tasks in parallel.
Improved performance for I/O or background tasks.
Enables responsive UI in GUI apps.
Ideal for real-time, web, and server-based applications.

20. Can we restart a thread in Java?
Answer:
No, a thread cannot be restarted once it enters the terminated (dead) state.
Once run() finishes or an exception occurs, the thread is dead.
You need to create a new Thread object to start the task again.

21. What is the ExecutorService in Java?
Answer:
ExecutorService is part of Java Concurrency API.
It manages thread creation and reuse internally.
Uses thread pools for better performance.
Supports asynchronous task execution.
Works with Runnable and Callable.
Example:

ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
service.submit(task);
22. What is Future in Java?
Answer:
Feature is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous task.
You submit the task, And feature will give the result only when the task is completed .

Completable Feature:-
Completable feature is an advanced feature that can run tasks asynchronously and also lets you attach callbacks , chain tasks and run tasks parallel without blocking.


23. What is ReentrantLock in Java? How is it different from synchronized?
Answer:
ReentrantLock is part of java.util.concurrent.locks and offers more control than synchronized.
It allows:
Explicit lock/unlock
Try-lock with timeout
Interruptible lock acquisition
It must be unlocked explicitly in a finally block.
Example:
lock.lock();
try { /* critical section */ } finally { lock.unlock(); }

24. What are the types of thread priorities in Java?
Answer:
Java threads have priorities from 1 (MIN_PRIORITY) to 10 (MAX_PRIORITY).
Default is 5 (NORM_PRIORITY).
You can set a thread’s priority using setPriority(int), but thread scheduling still depends on the OS.
Higher priority may run before lower ones, but it’s not guaranteed.

25. How to prevent thread interference in Java?
Answer:
Thread interference occurs when threads modify shared data without proper synchronization.
To prevent it:
Use synchronized blocks or methods
Use Lock classes like ReentrantLock
Use Atomic variables like AtomicInteger
Avoid shared mutable state where possible

26. What are CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch?
Answer:
Both are synchronization aids:
CountDownLatch waits for threads to complete, then proceeds.
CyclicBarrier waits until a fixed number of threads reach a common point, and then releases them all.
CountDownLatch can't be reused; CyclicBarrier can.

27. What is a thread-safe class? Give examples.
Answer:
A thread-safe class can be safely used by multiple threads at the same time without causing inconsistent data.
Examples:
Vector
Hashtable
ConcurrentHashMap
StringBuffer
Thread safety is achieved using synchronization, locks, or concurrent collections.

28. What is a BlockingQueue in Java?
Answer:
BlockingQueue is part of java.util.concurrent.
It supports thread-safe producer-consumer operations.
If the queue is full, put() blocks the producer.
If the queue is empty, take() blocks the consumer.
Popular implementations: ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue.

29. What is ForkJoinPool in Java?
Answer:
ForkJoinPool is used for parallel processing by splitting a task into smaller subtasks (fork), then combining their results (join).
It works well for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
It’s part of java.util.concurrent and supports RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction.

30. Can we make a class thread-safe without using synchronized?
Answer:
Yes, by using:
Atomic variables for counters
ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap
ThreadLocal for thread-specific storage
volatile for visibility of shared flags
Also, prefer immutable objects to avoid synchronization altogether.
